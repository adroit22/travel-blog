	  <h2>Bali: The refreshing beauty!!</h2>

  <p> This temple complex, called Temple Pura Ulun Danu Bratan, is built at the Tamblingan Lake. The temple and lake are surrounded by mountains scenery which makes it super picturesque.

  <p>After having traveled around the world, Bali still hails as the most relaxing destination I’ve ever been to — not to mention the greenest! Bali is an Indonesian island known for its expansive forests (and monkey friends!), volcanic mountains, iconic rice fields, beautiful beaches and coral reefs.</p>
  
  <p>Everything that surrounds you in Bali is alive- from the churning of the river, to the chirping of birds, to the patter of rain against palm leave (and even the traffic of the city!). It’s an amazing destination for a bustling and intriguing cultural experience while also being one of the best places to unwind, relax and focus on your wellness.</p>
