	  <h2>Bhutan: An inspiring journey!!</h2>
	  <p>Perched high in the Himalayas, Bhutan is a small dreamy paradise. Bhutan is the world’s last remaining Buddhist Kingdom. A visit here will bring you face to face with ancient monasteries, fortresses (called Dzongs), ancient temples with prayer flags fluttering high and the warmth of its people.</p>

        <p>Bhutan sounds exotic, mystical, almost otherworldly. Well, it feels that way too. Bhutan is such a joy to travel to, this tiny country straddling the Himalayas. If you want to see Bhutan before it gets to be modernized, go now. It is a feast for the eyes and an eye opening cultural experience. Explore the dzongs, marvel at the Himalayas, eat chilies and cheese, learn about Buddhism, and have one of the most unique travel experiences of your life.</p> 
		
		<p> Enigmatic and shrouded in myth, Bhutan is filled with tangible examples of its extraordinary culture, from the striking architecture of its mountain forts and monasteries to the images of Buddhist religious figures painted or carved onto the craggy cliffs. Colourful prayer flags flutter in spectacular mountain passes and prayer wheels turn slowly with the current of clear mountain streams. Grand examples of traditional design and architecture, Bhutan’s famous monasteries and ancient temples cling to sheer cliff tops or majestically stand guard in its picturesque towns.</p>

   <p>Experience breathtaking views of the Himalayan peaks on the spectacular descent into the Buddhist kingdom of Bhutan. Begin your spiritual journey at Changangkha Lhakang, a 12th-century temple in the Thimphu valley: meditate in the altar room and take part in the symbolic lighting of 108 butter lamps, before returning to Amankora's Thimphu lodge for a private astrology reading.</p>
   
  <p>Trek the vertiginous route to Tiger's Nest, the legendary monastery perched on a clifftop in Paro Valley. After sunrise meditation at Amankora, trek to Tiger's Nest, the legendary cliff-top monastery that rewards hikers with life-affirming views at its summit. The descent brings the promise of a visit to the Kingdom of Bhutan's oldest temple, Kyichu Lhakhang, and a soothing hot stone bath back at Amankora's Bhutanese spa.</p>
  
 
 
        <p>An array of Bhutanese, Western and Indian dishes are served across Bhutan, using local ingredients such as yak meat and fresh honey from the Bumthang Valley. Private dining can be arranged both inside and outside the Lodges, whether for an intimate dinner or group celebration</p>

  <p> Paro is a historic town with many sacred sites and historical buildings scattered through the area. It is home to many of Bhutan’s oldest temples and monasteries, National Museum and country’s only airport. After lunch, visit the National Museum. If time permits visit Kyichu Lhakhang. It is one of the oldest and most sacred shrines of the Kingdom dating back to 7th century. Late afternoon you arrive at your hotel, Uma Paro.</p>
  
  <p>While Bhutan is open to foreigners, they are aware of the environmental impact that tourism can have on their unique culture and pristine landscape. By implementing tourism restrictions, they have been able to preserve both these things which are not only special to them, but were such an honor to witness as travelers. Men and women continue to wear their respective ghos and kiras (national dress) on a daily basis, while children still take part in learning traditional music and dance. It seems that they have found a way to balance the ancient with the modern and are reaping the rewards of happiness from it.</p>
  
  <p>My trip to Bhutan was the perfect destination to end my adventure. After being immersed in the more chaotic settings of India spending a week in Bhutan was just the dose of calmness I needed. It’s a dose of calmness that – I think – everyone needs.</p>
