## Steps to make the code work

The GET request made to the Newsapi need an apiKey. The apiKey for my account is submitted with assignment on Blackboard. 

> Copy the apiKey and paste it inside the src/News.js file at line 19.
> After pasting the apiKey in side the url String inside the fetch method, the url would be something like -
"https://newsapi.org/v2/top-headlines?sources=bbc-news&apiKey=##########"

Once the apiKey has been added to News.js , go back to the project folder and then do -
